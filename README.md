Technical Objectives

Build a web app for 'Burnt Bob's Bistro' with Core Features: a menu page that updates every hour to reflect 'Tasty Tom's' latest creations, a backend API that can handle 'Tasty Tom's' unpredictable updates, and user authentication to ensure only 'Burnt Bob' can access the menu management system. Optional Features: implement a 'panic button' that temporarily freezes the menu in case of a culinary disaster and integrate a customer review system that can handle the hilarious and sometimes disastrous dishes created by 'Tasty Tom'.
